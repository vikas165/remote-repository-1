Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer who wanted to develop a language that was easy to read and write, yet powerful enough for serious software development. Inspired by the ABC programming language, which was designed for teaching, Python was intended to be a general-purpose language that emphasized code readability, simplicity, and flexibility. Van Rossum began working on Python during the Christmas holidays in 1989 and released the first version, Python 0.9.0, in February 1991.
